JI CHORDS AND THEIR DEVIATION FROM 12TET

The following is a list of chords that one might use to construct a 
harmonica tuning and how their just intonation forms deviate from 12 
tone equal temperament.  They are all listed with C as the root note 
and the other notes have a plus or minus figure measured in cents, 
showing how much they differ from 12TET (as measured by a chromatic 
tuner, for example).  If you set the root so many cents above or below 
12TET concert pitch, the you simply add or subtract the same number of 
cents from the remaining notes. As always, the fine tuning should be 
checked by ear, but these figures should at least get you into the ball 
park, as they say.



MAJOR TRIAD

C	E	G
0     -14   +2



MINOR TRIAD (5-Limit)

C	Eb	G
0     +16   +2



MINOR TRIAD (19-limit version - may be more suitable in some contexts; 
difference tones converge on the root of the chord; much closer to 
12TET than the 5-limit version, but also much less consonant)

C	Eb	G
0     -3	+2


DOMINANT SEVENTH (Pure Version - 7-Limit)

C	E	G	Bb
0     -14   +2    -31

(Note - this is the natural harmonic version of a dominant seventh 
chord. It produces a smooth, beat-free sound which is great when used 
as a I chord, but may sound a little too smooth when used as a V chord. 
You may prefer to use the following version of this chord, which 
produces a little more dissonance. )


DOMINANT SEVENTH ("Classical" Version - 5-Limit)

C	E	G	Bb
0     -14   +2    -4



DOMINANT NINTH

0     +16   +2    -12   +4



DIMINISHED SEVENTH (In most cases, this chord is probably best 
tuned in 12TET, but for certain purposes, a Just version might be 
useful)

C	Eb	Gb	Bbb
0     +16   -17   +18
