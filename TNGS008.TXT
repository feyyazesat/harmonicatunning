MAGIC DICK TUNINGS

US PATENT 5166461 SALWICZ/BEAUREGARD (There are names for these tunings, but they are not listed in the patent document. The first few (8.1etc.) are based on the standard major tuning, optimised for playing in cross position.  The 8.2etc variations are similar to altered Solo tunings and include some variations by other people.  All of these tunings emphasise 
the draw chord and most of them allow more draw bending capabilites. Those described as "chromatic" allow a chromatic scale using natural tones and bends (no overblows or overdraws needed). Other tunings included in the patent (augmented, diminished and spiral tunings and Melody Maker!!!) are included in other sections, as other people have had these ideas independently and in many cases previously.)
